MC-Runtime-Test enables you to run the Minecraft client within your CI/CD pipelines, simplifying the testing of runtime bugs in Minecraft mods.
Manual testing for different Minecraft versions and modloaders can be time-consuming, especially when bugs occur only in runtime environments launched via a Minecraft launcher.
This project helps streamline that process by automating the client launch and basic test execution.

## Fork Features
- Remove LWJGL entirely
- Support newer version of Minecraft⚠️

*⚠️ As of the time of writing, the original project only support 1.21.5 due to an issue with the LWJGL support.*

## Features
- Utilizes [HeadlessMC](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/headlessmc) for headless Minecraft launches.
- Employs Xvfb for virtual framebuffer support.
- Includes a lightweight mod that:
  - Join a single-player world.
  - Wait for chunks to load.
  - Quit the game after a few seconds.
- Supports Minecraft’s [GameTest Framework](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/creator/article/get-started-gametest-framework) to run registered tests for newer versions.

## Quickstart Example
Below is a basic workflow example to run the Minecraft client using MC-Runtime-Test.

<pre lang="yml">
---
name: Run Minecraft Client

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  java_version: 21

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: ${{ env.java_version }}
          distribution: "temurin"

      - name: [Example] Build mod
        run: ./gradlew build

      - name: [Example] Stage mod for test client
        run: |
          mkdir -p run/mods
          cp build/libs/&lt;your-mod&gt;.jar run/mods

      - name: Run MC test client
        uses: null2264/mc-runtime-test@5.3.0 <!-- x-release-please-version -->
        with:
          mc: 26.1
          modloader: fabric
          regex: .*fabric.*
          mc-runtime-test: fabric
          java: ${{ env.java_version }}
</pre>

---

## Caching
MC-Runtime-Test optionally caches `.minecraft` to improve execution time.
By default `cache-mc` is set to `github`, which uses `actions/cache`.
Set `cache-mc` to `false` to disable caching.

Another option is `blacksmith` for `blacksmith/cache`. 
Simply follow the instructions [here](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/introduction/quickstart)
to enable blacksmith for your repositories and enable the `cache-mc` input.

## Running Your Own Tests
MC-Runtime-Test supports Minecraft’s [Game-Test Framework](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/creator/article/get-started-gametest-framework). It executes `/test runall` upon joining a world.

> [!TIP]  
> Currently, Forge and NeoForge GameTest discovery may require additional setup, [hacks](gametest/src/main/java/me/earth/clientgametest/mixin/MixinGameTestRegistry.java), or other modifications to register structure templates correctly. We expect to simplify this for future releases.

You can also use the `headlessmc-command` input to specify a JVM argument to enforce the minimum number of GameTests you expect to be executed:

<pre lang="bash">
-DMcRuntimeGameTestMinExpectedGameTests=1
</pre>
